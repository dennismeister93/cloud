Eamon's 2025-04 short summary of the kind of steps I took to get macosx development minimally workable on a clean machine.
I'm NOT a frequent user of macos, so this might be missing obvious stuff, and I likely will have forgotten to note a few things.

Changing a few settings that annoyed me:

Settings > keyboard > Increase key repeat rate
Finder settings > show extensions, keep folders on top

Real necessities:
----

xcode-select --install 

(manually) install homebrew from https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/releases/

echo 'export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zshrc

brew install git
brew install git-lfs
brew install node
brew install nvm
brew install pnpm
brew install ollama
brew install postgresql@18
brew install 1password-cli

brew install --cask visual-studio-code
brew install --cask google-drive
brew install --cask slack
brew install --cask git-credential-manager
brew install --cask docker-desktop
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain

stripe login

Manual steps:
---

run docker GUI once (it configures CLI stuff so you can run docker compose up -d)
clone the gitrepos
run "git lfs install" in the repo? Not quite sure whether that's needed.
run vscode


Stuff I felt was useful:
----

brew install --cask firefox@beta
brew install --cask google-chrome
brew install --cask iterm2
brew install --cask scroll-reverser
brew install --cask clipy
brew install --cask dbeaver-community

brew install --cask meld #if you want it as a mergetool
brew install --cask handbrake #for tiny screenrecordings with AV1
brew install ffmpeg
brew install oh-my-posh
brew install ripgrep
brew install uv # for installation one of the mcp servers, forget which one
brew install nmap

Probably just me:
---
brew install dotnet # probably just me ;-)
brew install --cask keepassxc
brew install --cask pgadmin4 #vscode's plugin is maybe better?

defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 0; defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -float 0.15; killall Dock
#revert via: defaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier;defaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-delay; killall Dock
